# SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE AND BIODIVERSITY MONITORING WITHIN INTERTIDAL ZONES

**Project Overview**
This project integrates NASA ECOSTRESS and EMIT satellite data with in-situ field measurements collected across 
Southern California (LCDM, San Diego, and Palos Verdes sites). We investigate how well remote sensing captures
habitat characteristics and taxonomic biodiversity through algae types in tidepool environments by analyzing 
spectral reflectance variability. 

**Objectives**
- Compare satellite-derived and ground-collected reflectance data.
- Identify patterns in spectral diversity as a proxy for biodiversity.
- Determine spectral-temporal overlap between ECOSTRESS and EMIT scenes.
- Strengthen remote sensing workflows using Python and NASAâ€™s earthaccess.
